# SciFi
Create network of sci fi novels linked by shared concepts mentioned in the reviews.  

SciFi novels - Title, metadata, and text of all reviews/comments were scraped from Good Reads by Srini Kadamti.
Dictionary of important concepts and search terms to map onto those concepts was created by Bethanie Maples
Tags were added to each novel by matching search terms in the reviews/comments text and adding the associated concepts as keywords. Then novels were linked if they share similar keyword sets. The tag enhancement and network generation was done with Tag2Network created by Rich Williams
